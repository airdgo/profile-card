## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned how to use felxbox in order to center a container and elements within that container.

```css
body {
    background: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I intend on learning more about flexbox and how to make a website responsive. Also I want to get more familiar with css units.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://flexbox.help) - This helped me understand flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
